## 🧩 Featured Projects
- **Tokyo Olympics 2020 Data Engineering Pipeline** (May 2025)
    - *Technologies: Python, Azure Data Lake Gen2, Databricks, PySpark, SQL, Tableau, Apache Airflow*
    - Implemented a scalable data pipeline for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics using Python, Azure Data Lake Gen2, Databricks (PySpark), SQL, Tableau, and Apache Airflow.        Ingested and transformed multi-format data via Azure Data Factory and Databricks, producing insights like medal tallies, gender participation, and event            trends. Visualized metrics in Tableau dashboards and automated daily data refreshes with Airflow.
- **Retail Sales Analytics Pipeline** (April 2025)
    - *Technologies: Python, SQL, SQLite, Tableau, Pandas*
    - Developed an analytics pipeline with Python, SQL (SQLite), Tableau, and Pandas to clean, transform, and analyze retail sales data. Created SQL queries to extract KPIs like sales trends and profit margins, and built a dynamic Tableau dashboard to support data-driven inventory and marketing decisions.
  
- **Real-Time Outlier Detection System (NETS Algorithm)** (April 2025)
    -  *Technologies: C++, Grid-based Indexing, Streaming Simulation* 
    -  Implemented a high-speed outlier detection engine in C++ for streaming data, leveraging grid-based indexing and efficient dimensional filtering. Benchmarked the system across multiple datasets, achieving a 100x speedup over baseline methods.

- **Crime Forecasting Using Spatiotemporal Models** (September 2024)
    - *Technologies: Python, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), LSTM/GRU*
    - Engineered a data pipeline and predictive models with Python, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and LSTM/GRU layers to forecast crime likelihood in Chicago, demonstrating how spatiotemporal modeling improves real-time adaptability in urban safety planning.
